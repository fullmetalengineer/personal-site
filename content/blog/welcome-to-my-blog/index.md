I'm Alan, and welcome to my blog!

I'm just a fella on the internet with opinions about things. What sort of things, you ask?

Software, mostly. It's my day job, my (professional) love interest, and working in software development makes me happy to work each day (which is far more than I can say about my Accounting degree).

Since this is a personal blog, you're also going to get a mix of posts that have absolutely nothing to do with software. I have several other hobbies that I enjoy talking about:

- Weightlifting
- Parenthood
- Writing fiction
- Bitcoin
- Practical Prepping (no tinfoil/chemtrails; at least, not much)
- Personal Finance

This blog intentionally does not have a comment section. This is a place for me to organize and distribute my thoughts, free of noise, leaving only what I consider to be signal.

I hope you enjoy.
