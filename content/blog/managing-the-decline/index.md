![Failure is acceptable](https://i.ibb.co/sCXjVWg/image.png)

We're increasingly seeing a deliberate & intricately-managed institutional decline in an accelerated decay pattern across most of our (American) social institutions. The generalized response appears to simply be to shrug our shoulders and mumble that "failure is okay".

System failures are (generally) multivariate institutional breakdowns across a number of critical social institutional nodes. A number of factors go into institutional decline, and this is no different.

Clearly, a pragmatist would say 'we have a problem'. Undoubtedly, a well-functioning human being would think, 'we should change how the system functions, change its inputs'.

But we no longer live in the age of competence at the helm. That was, as they say, 'problematic'.

We have an entire generation of kids now being deliberately set up to fail, and moreso, told that it's ok to fail. The people that Amerian children listen to daily for hours at a time, people those opinions and beliefs they internalize, are not even pretending that failure is considered bad or wrong. They're framing it as some kind of reality-check.

Allowing a generation of children to lose a year or more from their education is not something that the students can easily get back if they stay within the public education system, as the overwhelming majority of them will do. I don't even think that public education imparts anything of serious worth to students, but I'm sure some students benefit from it in some capacity.

These sort of examples illustrates really how low-trust America has become. People described "low-trust" when discussing watching your home turn into the Star Wars cantina, but this is really what truly low-trust societies look like. You can't trust educators to even attempt to ensure success, much less actually deliver it. They've now informed you directly that they don't care, and won't be pushing it.

You can't trust your medicine or food to not be toxic. You can't trust the teachers to teach anything beyond regime propaganda. You can't trust your neighbors or even family to not to report you for large family gatherings. You can't trust anyone to tell you the truth.

__You simply can't trust anything.__

You are forced to spend your precious time determining if what you're being told is the truth multiple times per day. And even then, who really knows?

Another example from earlier in 2020 is when the CDC and the entirety of the "Free Press" (read: regime propagandists) were telling you at the beginning of the pandemic that masks don't work, don't buy them, don't bother. I remember that within the very same month, you were a pariah if you:

1) insisted on wearing masks
2) insisted on not wearing masks

as the CDC 'updated their guidance' to decide that masks actually did work to reduce transmission to some degree.

Nothing actually changed with regards to whether masks were effective, of course. Everyone with 2 brain cells to rub together knew that masks help reduce the spread of illness, to some degree. The point was never to protect you or to have your well-being in mind; the point was for connected people ('insiders') to be able to hoard and plunder as much for themselves from the public as they could.

Often, they just wanted to turn a profit on re-selling the masks at marked-up valuations.

This organization, tasked with extraordinarily critical missions, has been laughably bad at responding to this relative nothing-burger of a pandemic. They've been consistently late by months on a number of critical pieces of information regarding the virus's spread mechanisms, prevention, and treatment. It really begins to make one wonder just how much of a paper tiger the USG might actually be, in kinetic terms. Culturally, we are the [1KYAE](https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/basic-concepts-1kyae), and that won't change for some time. Economically, we're more integrated with the globe than pretty much nearly any other empire throughout known history. Everyone has their strengths, I suppose.

But after the large-scale shoulder-shrugging our education system has done this year, and after the public failure of the CDC to respond seriously and decisively to a pandemic, you have to be wondering:

__Who can you trust? What can you trust? What still works?__

In America, there's not many institutions that have any serious amount of public trust remaining in them. And that, gentle reader, is a problem.
